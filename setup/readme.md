Thank you for wanting to use Imaginative Engine!

running the setup bat will...

Install openfl and lime (required for flixel to run),
flixel and flixel-addons but the CNE forks because there better.

As well as other libraries such as...
CNE's hscript-improved for scripting,
CNE's hxdiscord_rpc for discord stuff,
and lastly hxvlc for video's.
