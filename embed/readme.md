# embed/
This is basically the [`engine/`](/engine/) folder but anything in here will be embedded into the exe.
#### Note: Things may not work 100% when embedded, so be careful.

Also the `.gitkeep` files are just so compiling through action builds isn't stupid.
#
##### TODO: Rework to just be `filename.embed.extension`. Might need to switch from a xml to hxp project file for that.
